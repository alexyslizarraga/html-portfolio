<h2>1. Game of Thrones</h2>
<b1>No competition there. It's the GOAT. Dragons, politics, period piece. It's so GOOD. We love the mix of realism and unpredictability which keeps me on the edge of my seat. Mr. George R. R. Martin does a gr8 job at making me scared for my fav characters (he needs to stop having a life and write those last 2 book already!!) </b1>


<h2>2. Breaking Bad</h2>
<b1>It's a rich story about the complexities of human nature, the pursuit of power, and the consequences of our actions. Trust, it's good fr fr </b1> 

<h2>3. Vikings </h2>
<b1>I love shows based on historical events. Not me learning and being entertained. </b1>
